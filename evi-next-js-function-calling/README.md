# EVI Next.js Function Calling Example

## Introduction
This project is an example of how to call functions in a Next.js application using EVI. Here, we have a simple EVI that calls a function to get the current weather for a given location.

## EVI setup
1. Create a tool with the following payload: <Zachary insert here>
2. Create a config with that tool: <Zachary insert here>
3. Add the Config ID to your environment variables.

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/evi-next-js-function-calling.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd evi-next-js-function-calling`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Add your environment variables, including your Config ID and Geocoding API key (free to use from [from geocode.maps.co](https://geocode.maps.co/)).

## Usage

To run the project, use the command: `npm run dev`

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
