[2024-12-17 12:01:21] User: About, like, how to stop the max duration.
[2024-12-17 12:01:23] Assistant: If you're dealing with the maximum duration issue in a system, you might want to consider strategies such as optimizing processes to be faster, increasing the allowed duration if possible, or splitting tasks into smaller segments that can be completed within the allowed time.
[2024-12-17 12:01:48] User: Okay. That sounds okay. But I'm talking about your max duration, like, sending a max duration message to you.
