  <h1>Empathic Voice Interface | TypeScript Webhook Example</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Receive and Handle Webhook Events from Hume's Empathic Voice Interface (EVI)</strong>
  </p>
</div>

## Overview

**This project demonstrates how to:**

- Set up a basic (Node) Express server to receive webhook events from Hume's [Empathic Voice Interface (EVI)](https://dev.hume.ai/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/overview).
- Handle `chat_started` and `chat_ended` webhook events.
- Process events to create workflows, such as generating transcripts or logging session details.

**Key Features:**

- **Webhook integration:** Configurable endpoint to receive real-time events.
- **Event handling:** Parse and process `chat_started` and `chat_ended` events with Python utilities.
- **Extensibility:** A base framework for building advanced workflows triggered by EVI events.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (`v18.0.0` or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (`v8.0.0` or higher)

To check the versions of `pnpm` and `Node.js` installed on a Mac via the terminal, you can use the following commands:

1. **For Node.js**, enter the following command and press Enter:

```bash
node -v
```

This command will display the version of Node.js currently installed on your system, for example, `v21.6.1`.

2. **For pnpm**, type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
pnpm -v
```

This command will show the version of `pnpm` that is installed, like `8.10.0`.

If you haven't installed these tools yet, running these commands will result in a message indicating that the command was not found. In that case, you would need to install them first. Node.js can be installed from its official website or via a package manager like Homebrew, and `pnpm` can be installed via npm (which comes with Node.js) by running `npm install -g pnpm` in the terminal.

## Setup

### Setting up credentials

- **Obtain Your API Key**: Follow the instructions in the [Hume documentation](https://dev.hume.ai/docs/introduction/api-key) to acquire your API key.
- **Create a `.env` File**: In the project's root directory, create a `.env` file if it doesn't exist. Add your API key:

```sh
HUME_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

Refer to `.env.example` as a template.

### Install dependencies

Install the required dependencies with pnpm: `pnpm install`

## Usage

### Running the server

Start the Express server by running the `main.ts` file:

`pnpm start`

### Testing the webhook

Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or a similar tool to expose your local server to the internet:

`ngrok http 5000`

Copy the public URL generated by ngrok and update your webhook configuration in the Hume **Config**:

- **Webhook URL**: `<NGROK_PUBLIC_URL>/hume-webhook`
- **Events**: Subscribe to `chat_started` and `chat_ended`.

## How It Works

1. **Webhook Endpoint**: The Express server listens for POST requests at `/hume-webhook`.
2. **Event Processing**:
   - `chat_started`: Logs session details or triggers workflows.
   - `chat_ended`: Processes chat data to generate transcripts or perform analytics.
3. **Custom Logic**: Extend the event handler functions in `main.ts` to integrate with your systems.
