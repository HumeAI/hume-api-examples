  <h1>Empathic Voice Interface | Python Quickstart</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Jumpstart your development with Hume's Empathic Voice Interface!</strong>
  </p>
</div>

## Overview

This project features a minimal implementation of Hume's [Empathic Voice Interface (EVI)](https://dev.hume.ai/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/overview) using Hume's [Python SDK](https://github.com/HumeAI/hume-python-sdk). It demonstrates how to authenticate, connect to, and display output from EVI in a terminal application.

See the [Quickstart guide](https://dev.hume.ai/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/quickstart/python) for a detailed explanation of the code in this project.

## Prerequisites

The Hume Python SDK supports Python versions `3.9`, `3.10`, and `3.11` on macOS and Linux systems.

It does not currently support Windows. Windows developers can use our [Python Raw API Example](/evi/python/evi-python-raw-api/README.md) to work directly with the [EVI WebSocket API](https://dev.hume.ai/reference/empathic-voice-interface-evi/chat/chat).

## Quickstart

Visit the [API keys page](https://platform.hume.ai/settings/keys) on the Hume Platform to retrieve your API keys. See our documentation on [getting your api keys](https://dev.hume.ai/docs/introduction/api-key). Then, follow the steps below:

```shell
# 1. Clone the examples repo
git clone https://github.com/humeai/hume-api-examples
# 2. Navigate to this example project
cd hume-api-examples/evi/evi-python-quickstart

# 3a. With the `uv` package manager (recommended)
uv sync
uv run python

# 3b. Or, use pip
pip install python-dotenv
pip install hume[microphone]

# 4. Copy the .env.example file to .env
cp .env.example .env
# Open the file and add your Hume API Key
```
   
## System dependencies

### macOS

To ensure audio playback functionality, you will need to install `ffmpeg`, a powerful multimedia framework that handles audio and video processing.

One of the most common ways to install `ffmpeg` on macOS is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Homebrew is a popular package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software by automating the process of downloading, compiling, and setting up packages.

To install `ffmpeg` using Homebrew, follow these steps:

1. Install Homebrew onto your system according to the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `ffmpeg` with:
   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

If you prefer not to use Homebrew, you can download a pre-built `ffmpeg` binary directly from the [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or use other package managers like [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).

### Linux

On Linux systems, you will need to install a few additional packages to support audio input/output and playback:

- `libasound2-dev`: This package contains development files for the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) sound system.
- `libportaudio2`: PortAudio is a cross-platform audio I/O library that is essential for handling audio streams.
- `ffmpeg`: Required for processing audio and video files.

To install these dependencies, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get --yes update
sudo apt-get --yes install libasound2-dev libportaudio2 ffmpeg
```

### Windows

Not yet supported.

## Run the project

Below are the steps to run the project:

1. Create a virtual environment using venv, conda or other method.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Install the required packages and system dependencies.
4. Execute the script by running `python quickstart.py`.
5. Terminate the script by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
